The BioMedical Information Collection and Understanding System (BioMedICUS) leverages open source solutions for
text analysis and provides new analytic tools for processing and analyzing text of biomedical and clinical reports.
The system is being developed by our biomedical NLP/IE program at the University of Minnesota.
This is a collaborative project that aims to serve biomedical and clinical researchers, allowing for customization
with different texts.

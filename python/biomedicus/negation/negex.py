"""An implementation of the NegEx algorithm.

NegEx was originally published by Wendy Chapman et al. in "A Simple Algorithm for Identifying
Negated Findings and Diseases in Discharge Summaries", Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 301â€“310
(2001). This is a Python implementation of the algorithm using the updated triggers list.

The BioMedical Information Collection and Understanding System (BioMedICUS) is a system for large-scale text analysis and processing of biomedical and clinical reports. The system is being developed by the Natural Language Processing and Information Extraction Program at the University of Minnesota Institute for Health Informatics.

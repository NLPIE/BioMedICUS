BioMedICUS is a system for large-scale text analysis and processing of
biomedical and clinical reports. The system is developed by the Natural
Language Processing and Information Extraction Program at the University of
Minnesota Institute for Health Informatics.

### Project Goals
- Scalability and performance.
- Usability. We try to minimize dependencies and prerequisites that BioMedICUS requires. We release
under the permissive Apache 2.0 license and pay close attention to intellectual property issues.
